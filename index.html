		This plugin adds "Open Project <u>F</u>ast [...]" menu item in the "File" menu. This menu opens the project currently selected in the clipboard, and thereby allowing the following workflow that lets you open a project more quickly.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Select a project in Explorer/Nautilus</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Select a <tt>.ipr</tt> file, <tt>pom.xml</tt>, or a directory that contains either of those in Windows Explorer, GNOME Nautilus, Konquerer, or any other file manager.
		<li>Come back to IntelliJ IDEA, type "Alt+F > F" to open that project.
	</ol>
	
	<h4>Select a project from anywhere</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Send a file name of a <tt>.ipr</tt> file, <tt>pom.xml</tt>, or a directory that contains either of those from your editor, your shell, your web browser, your e-mail, or just about anywhere.
		<li>Come back to IntelliJ IDEA, type "Alt+F > F" to open that project.
	</ol>
	
	<p>
		This plugin is particularly effective when you have a small shell script that lets you send arbitrary file name into clipboard. On Unix, such script would look something like:
	</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
D=`dirname "$1"`
B=`basename "$1"`
abspath="`cd \"$D\" 2>/dev/null && pwd || echo \"$D\"`/$B"
echo $abspath | <a href="http://people.debian.org/~kims/xclip/">xclip</a> -selection clipboard
</pre>
	<p>
		On Windows it will look something like this:
	</p>
<pre>
@echo off
echo %~f1 | <a href="http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/clipboard/">clipboard</a> -
</pre>
	<p>
		In this way, you can pick a project easily from a shell, by taking advantage of a file name completion and other smart features in shell like <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/zsh_13.html#SEC61">this</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>If you need it to be even more quicker...</h3>
	<p>
	  This plugin also opens a TCP port 39524 and waits for a connection. You can have the plugin open a project by simply sending a directory name that contains <tt>.ipr</tt> or <tt>pom.xml</tt>, or a name of those files. For example, on Unix, such script could be:
	</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
D=`dirname "$1"`
B=`basename "$1"`
abspath="`cd \"$D\" 2>/dev/null && pwd || echo \"$D\"`/$B"
echo $abspath | nc -q 1 localhost 39524
</pre>
    <p>
      I haven't tried this on Windows, but I suppose <tt>telnet</tt> command would do.
